        <h2> Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <P> We want to design an app that creates a space for people to share, connect, and support each other through music. 
            Joining college can be challenging and it can feel hard to find ways to connect with people from a 
            variety of backgrounds. Music, however, is a universal language. It allows us to share how weâ€™re 
            feeling, connect over new sounds, and create a shared experience. Music can also work as a form of 
            therapy. It can help us feel safe, remind us of home, and help us complete tasks such as studying for 
            a project or cleaning the house. Overall, music is a powerful tool for connection and collaboration 
            which is why we want to help create a space that supports students socially in a way that supports 
            connection outside of the pressures of typical social media apps. </p>


        <p> An information technology problem in the space is the challenge with current social media apps. 
            There are a lot of spaces for students to connect with each other such as Instagram, Snapchat, 
            Discord, etc however all of those spaces can also be overwhelming and hard to know what to post 
            or share. Especially with social media apps like Instagram and Tik Tok, there can be a lot of 
            pressure to show something cool you're doing or get a certain amount of likes. With our app we 
            want to encourage a space that involves sharing playlists, finding new music, and linking this 
            to where you are on campus and what you may be up to even if that's just working out at the 
            IMA or studying at Ode. One previous existing attempt to solve this problem is 
            <a href  =https://musicmatch.net/ >Music Match for Artists</a> which helps artists match music 
            and evolve their own music style. However this focuses on matching and encouraging music from 
            an artists perspective where we want to focus on an app for students and sharing music and 
            playlists that already exist. </p>
